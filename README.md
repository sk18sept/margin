This file is automatically generated by the algo to capture the performance of the algo on a daily basis.
The columns used in the file and their meaning is as follows - 

\nMargin - The total money "available to the algo" in the trading account for that day. Some money may have been blocked due to other trades which have not been taken by the algo. Such trades are not considered by the algo.
Underlying	- The instrument chosen to trade on that particular day.
multiplier_used	- It basically represents the qty which has been traded for a particular day and depends on the margin available.
highest_pnl	- This is the maximum profit reached by the algo during the day's trading.
pnl	-  This is the final profit/loss of the algo for the day. Of course, it can never be more than highest_pnl.
pnl_pct -  This is the profit/loss as a percentage of the "Total Money available in the trading acct". In order for this to represent the total effect on the acct, it considers the total money available in the account and not the margin available for trading on that particular day.
